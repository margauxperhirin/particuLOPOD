#' @name list_custom
#' @description Extracts available Aphia_ID (Worms ID) corresponding to user-defined criteria
#' from the custom database provided by the user. The function filters the data based on
#' the user's sample selection criteria (e.g., depth, year) and removes unnecessary metadata.
#' 
#' @param DATA_SOURCE File path to the data source (.xlsx, .txt, or .csv format)
#' @param SAMPLE_SELECT A list containing user-defined filtering criteria, including depth and time ranges
#' @param FOLDER_NAME Folder name where output files should be saved (if needed)
#' @return A filtered list of available Worms/Aphia IDs and the number of occurrences within the selected samples
